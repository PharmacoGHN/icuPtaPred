      <br> <b> Introduction : </b> Pharmacokinetic changes are often seen in patients with severe infections. Administration by continuous infusion has been suggested to optimize
        antibiotic exposure and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment for β-lactams. 
      <br> <strong> Methods : </strong> In an observational study, unbound piperacillin concentrations (n = 196) were assessed in 78
        critically ill patients following continuous infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam (ratio 8:1). The initial dose of 8, 12, or 16 g (piperacillin component) was determined
        by individual creatinine clearance (CRCL). Piperacillin concentrations were compared to the EUCAST clinical breakpoint MIC for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 mg/liter),
        and the following PK/PD targets were evaluated: 100% free time (fT) > 1× MIC and 100% fT > 4× MIC. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using NONMEM 7.4.3
        consisting of a one-compartment disposition model with linear elimination separated into nonrenal and renal (linearly increasing with patient CRCL) clearances.
        Target attainment was predicted and visualized for all individuals based on the utilized CRCL dosing algorithm.
      <br> <strong> Results : </strong> The target of 100% fT > 1× MIC was achieved for all patients based on the administered dose, but few patients achieved the target of
        100% fT > 4× MIC. Probability of target attainment for a simulated cohort of patients showed that increasing the daily dose by 4-g increments (piperacillin component) 
        did not result in substantially improved target attainment for the 100% fT > 4× MIC target. 
      <br> <strong> Conclusion : </strong> To conclude, in patients with high CRCL combined with high-MIC bacterial infections, even a continuous infusion (CI) 
        regimen with a daily dose of 24 g may be insufficient to achieve therapeutic concentrations.",

      <br> <strong> Objectives : </strong> This study aimed to characterize the population pharmacokinetics (PKs) of piperacillin and investigate probability of
        target attainment (PTA) and cumulative fraction of response (CFR) of various dosage regimens in critically ill patients during the early phase of sepsis.
      <br> <strong> Methods : </strong>  Forty-eight patients treated with piperacillin/tazobactam were recruited. 
        Five blood samples were drawn before and during 0-0.5, 0.5-2, 2-4 and 4-6 or 8 h after administration. Population PKs was analyzed using NONMEM®.
        The PTA of 90%fT>MIC target and CFR were determined by Monte Carlo simulation.
      <br> <strong> Results : </strong> The two compartment model best described the data. Piperacillin clearance (CL) was 5.37 L/h, central volume of distribution
        (V1) was 9.35 L, and peripheral volume of distribution was 7.77 L. Creatinine clearance (CLCr) and mean arterial pressure had a significant effect on CL
        while adjusted body weight had a significant impact on V1. Subtherapeutic concentrations can occur during the early phase of sepsis in critically ill patients with normal
        renal function. The usual dosage regimen, 4 g of piperacillin infused over 0.5 h every 6 h, could not achieve the target for susceptible organisms with MIC 16 mg/L

      <br> <strong> <i> Introduction </i> </strong> The aim of this study was to explore the impact of augmented creatinine clearance and
        differing minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) on piperacillin pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment (time above MIC (fT>MIC))
      in critically ill patients with sepsis receiving intermittent dosing.
      <br> <strong> <i> Methods </i> </strong> To be eligible for enrolment, critically ill patients with sepsis had to be receiving piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g
        intravenously (IV) by intermittent infusion every 6 hours for presumed or confirmed nosocomial infection without significant renal impairment (defined by a 
        plasma creatinine concentration greater than 171 μmol/L or the need for renal replacement therapy). Over a single dosing interval, blood samples were drawn 
        to determine unbound plasma piperacillin concentrations. Renal function was assessed by measuring creatinine clearance (CLCR). A population PK model was constructed,
        and the probability of target attainment (PTA) for 50% and 100% fT>MIC was calculated for varying MIC and CLCR values.
      <br> <strong> <i> Results </i> </strong> In total, 48 patients provided data. Increasing CLCR values were associated with lower trough plasma piperacillin concentrations
        (P < 0.01), such that with an MIC of 16 mg/L, 100% fT>MIC would be achieved in only one-third (n = 16) of patients. Mean piperacillin clearance was approximately 1.5-fold
        higher than in healthy volunteers and correlated with CLCR (r = 0.58, P < 0.01). A reduced PTA for all MIC values, when targeting either 50% or 100% fT>MIC,
        was noted with increasing CLCR measures.
      <br> <strong> <i> Conclusions </i> </strong> Standard intermittent piperacillin-tazobactam dosing is unlikely to achieve optimal piperacillin exposures in a significant
        proportion of critically ill patients with sepsis, owing to elevated drug clearance. These data suggest that CLCR can be employed as a useful tool to determine whether
        piperacillin PK/PD target attainment is likely with a range of MIC values.

      <br> <strong> Objectives: </strong> We aimed to identify rational empirical dosing strategies for cefepime treatment in critically ill patients by utilizing
      population pharmacokinetics and target attainment analysis.
      <br> <strong> Patients and methods: </strong> A prospective and opportunistic pharmacokinetic (PK) study was conducted in 130 critically ill patients
      in two ICU sites. The plasma concentrations of cefepime were determined using a validated LC-MS/MS method. All cefepime PK data were analysed
      simultaneously using the non-linear mixed-effects modelling approach. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate the PTA of cefepime at different
      MIC values following different dose regimens in subjects with different renal functions.
      <br> <strong> Results: </strong> The PK of cefepime in critically ill patients was best characterized by a two-compartment model with zero-order input
      and first-order elimination. Creatinine clearance and body weight were identified to be significant covariates.
      Our simulation results showed that prolonged 3 h infusion does not provide significant improvement on target attainment compared with the traditional
      intermittent 0.5 h infusion. In contrast, for a given daily dose continuous infusion provided much higher breakpoint coverage than either 0.5h or 3h intermittent infusions.
      To balance the target attainment and potential neurotoxicity, cefepime 3 g/day continuous infusion appears to be a better dosing regimen than 6 g/day continuous infusion.
      <br> <strong> Conclusions: </strong> Continuous infusion may represent a promising strategy for cefepime treatment in critically ill patients. With the availability of
      institution- and/or unit-specific cefepime susceptibility patterns as well as individual patients' renal function, our PTA results may represent useful
      references for physicians to make dosing decisions.

      <br> <strong> Methods : </strong> This was a prospective study of critically ill adults hospitalized at an academic medical center treated with intravenous cefepime.

      <br> <strong> <i> Purpose :     </i> </strong> Creatinine clearance (CCr) and pharmacokinetic parameters are markedly affected by pathophysiological
        changes in patients with sepsis. However, only a few reports have assessed renal function in patients with sepsis using the measured CCr. Furthermore,
        the administration regimen has not been sufficiently evaluated using a population PK (PPK) model across renal function broad ranges. Therefore, this study was
        performed to construct a meropenem PPK model for patients with sepsis using the measured CCr and evaluate the optimized meropenem dosing regimen based on the CCr.
      <br> <strong> <i> Methods :     </i> </strong> Patients with sepsis who received intravenous meropenem at the Showa University Hospital were enrolled in this 
        prospective observational study. The PPK model was constructed using blood samples and clinical information of patients. The probability of target attainment (PTA)
        indicates the likelihood of achieving 50% time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (% T > MIC) based on 10,000 virtual patients using Monte Carlo simulations.
        The PTA for each meropenem regimen was 50% T > MIC based on different renal functions using the Monte Carlo simulation.
      <br> <strong> <i> Results :     </i> </strong> One hundred samples were collected from 31 patients. The final PPK model incorporating the measured CCr as a covariate in CL
        displayed the best fit. The recommended dosing regimen to achieve a PTA of 50% T > MIC of 4 mcg/mL was 1 g every 8 hours as a 3-hour prolonged infusion for patients with
        CCr 85-130 mL/min and 1 g every 8 hours as an 8-hour continuous infusion for patients with CCr ≥ 130 mL/min.
      <br> <strong> <i> Conclusions : </i> </strong> This model precisely predicted meropenem concentrations in patients with sepsis by accurately evaluating renal
        function using the measured CCr. Extended dosing was demonstrated to be necessary to achieve a PTA of 50% T > MIC for patients with CCr ≥ 85 mL/min. Meropenem effectiveness

      <br> <strong> Objectives: </strong> Ceftazidime/avibactam is a key antibiotic for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) Gram-negative infections, but
        current dosing may be suboptimal to grant activity. This study explores the population pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of continuous infusion (CI)
        ceftazidime/avibactam for maximizing treatment efficacy in critically ill patients.
      <br> <strong> Methods: </strong> A retrospective analysis of adult patients receiving CI ceftazidime/avibactam and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of both
        compounds was performed. Population PK/PD modelling identified the most accurate method for estimating ceftazidime/avibactam clearance based on kidney function
        and Monte Carlo simulations investigated the relationship between various CI dosing regimens and aggressive joint PK/PD target attainment of ceftazidime/avibactam.
      <br> <strong> Results: </strong> The European Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) equation best described kidney function for ceftazidime/avibactam clearance.
        The findings challenge the current approach of only reducing the ceftazidime/avibactam dose based on kidney function by identifying dose adjustments in patients
        with augmented kidney function. Our CI ceftazidime/avibactam dosing strategies, adjusted by TDM, showed promise for achieving optimal aggressive joint PK/PD
        targets and potentially improving clinical/microbiological outcomes against KPC- and OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales. The risk of neurotoxicity associated with
        these strategies appears acceptable.
      <br> <strong> Conclusions: </strong> This study suggests that adjusting ceftazidime/avibactam dosing regimen based solely on eCLcr might be suboptimal for critically
        ill patients. Higher daily doses delivered by CI and adjusted based on TDM have the potential to improve aggressive joint PK/PD target attainment and potentially
        clinical/microbiological outcomes. Further investigations are warranted to confirm these findings and establish optimal TDM-guided dosing strategies for
        ceftazidime/avibactam in clinical practice.",
